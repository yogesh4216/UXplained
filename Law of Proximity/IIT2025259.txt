Explanation:

The textbook definition of 'Law of Proximity" is that people perceive objects close to each other as belonging to a group,
forming relationships and patterns based on their physical closeness rather than unrelated attributes like shape or color.

In the figma draft I provided, it shows two examples, left one showing poor proximity and other showing good proximity:

In the left design, there is no visual grouping, that is all tasks are mixed together.
This makes navigation harder, i.e. user must scroll thorugh the entire list looking for a specific task.
It increases cognitive load as user must read every item to understand relationships.

In the right design, related items are placed together and given a heading.
Groups have clear spacing between them, making the structure approachable.
Navigation is easier as headings make groups clear and the user won't have to read through all tasks to find a specific task.
