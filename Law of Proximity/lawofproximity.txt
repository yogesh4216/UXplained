This design demonstrates the Law of Proximity using two clear states:

Grouped Elements (Good Proximity):
Related form fields (card number, expiry date, full name) are placed close together, with action buttons 
separated by extra spacing. Consistent alignment and spacing make relationships clear, improve readability, 
and guide the user logically from input to action.

Ungrouped Elements (Poor Proximity):
Related fields are spaced inconsistently, and the submit button is placed between inputs. 
This breaks logical grouping, increases cognitive load, and makes the form harder to scan and understand.

Key Principle:
Spacing and alignment alone communicate structure. Proper proximity improves clarity; 
poor proximity creates confusion.
