Bad Proximity (Left Side)

-On the left card, everything is spread out almost the same way.
-The name, level, rank, points, and progress all feel unrelated
-Nothing is clearly grouped, so the user has to slow down and read carefully
-The “Add Friend” button doesn’t feel like part of the profile

How it feels:
A bit confusing and messy. You’re working harder than you should.

Good Proximity (Right Side)

-On the right card, related things are kept close.
-The profile picture, name, and level sit together
-Rank and shopping points are grouped with icons
-Extra space separates different sections clearly
-The “Add Friend” button feels like the natural next step

How it feels:
Clean, calm, and easy to understand at a glance.
