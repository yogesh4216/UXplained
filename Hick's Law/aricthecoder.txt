Explaination:

This UI demonstrates Hick’s Law, which states that the time it takes for a user to make a decision increases as the number of choices increases.

/////////// Left screen (Poor application of Hick’s Law):
The user is presented with a long, scrollable list of mood options that are very similar in meaning. 
Because there are too many choices, the user has to read, compare, and think before selecting one. This increases cognitive load, slows decision-making, and can even cause hesitation or frustration.

//////////  Right screen (Good application of Hick’s Law):
The same question is asked, but the options are reduced to a small, well-defined set. 
Each choice is clearly distinct and visible without scrolling. 
This limits mental effort, helps the user quickly recognize their mood, and enables faster, more confident decisions.

////////// Conclusion:
By reducing and organizing choices, the right design respects Hick’s Law and creates a smoother, more efficient user experience, while the left design overwhelms users and delays decision-making.
