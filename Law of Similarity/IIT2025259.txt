Explanation:
Law of Similarity states that elements that look similar are percieved as related.

The design I provided is that of the news website homepage.

The differences between the bad design and the good design are ass follows:

The nav bar in bad design has links to other webpages but all the links have different colour and don't follow a pattern.
The nav bar in the good design has all links to web pages in the same colour, showing that their behaviour is the same.

Buttons in the bad design (sign in and subscribe) can't be differentiated from the other nav bar links.
Buttons in the good design are given distinct style.

News tags in the bad design are all given the same colour. In the good design they are given different colours to differentiate between them.

Advertisement in the bad design cannot be differentiated from other news articles. In the good design the ad is given a distinct shape and region.
The "Ad" tag is also given a different style differentiating it from other news tags.
